# CogniTrack
This project develops a deep learning model, specifically using a pre-trained DenseNet121 architecture, to classify MRI brain images into four categories representing Alzheimer's disease stages: Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of these images using standard supervised learning techniques. The process involves data loading, preprocessing (resizing, normalization), splitting into training and validation sets, and training with learning rate scheduling and early stopping. The goal is to create a model capable of accurately predicting the Alzheimer's stage from unseen MRI scans.
